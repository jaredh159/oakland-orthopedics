                Recently, one of the physicians on national news referred to the health
                benefits of ultra violet light. Though he didnâ€™t say it, he was indirectly
                referring to the increase in vitamin D that comes from sunshine on your
                skin. As an orthopedic surgeon I have long been aware of the necessity of
                high levels of vitamin D for good bone health.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I have also learned is that vitamin D is perhaps the most powerful
                booster of your immune system.<sup>1</sup> Recently I have read two
                studies that confirm that high levels of vitamin D will prevent flu better
                than a flu shot.<sup>2</sup>
                <sup>, 3</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Many studies suggest that about 70% of our population is deficient in
                blood levels of vitamin D (including even the Pittsburgh Steelers!)
                Therefore, I find it incredible that almost none of our many health
                experts has ever mentioned this extremely helpful preventive treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The standard recommended dose of vitamin D for adults is 5000IU daily. If
                you have not taken vitamin D before you will need a loading dose of
                20,000u daily for 5 days. The blood level of vitamin D needed to prevent
                flu is approximately 75 - 100ng/ml.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, almost everyone knows the vitamin C is also good for
                preventing and healing viral illnesses. A good dose for vitamin C would be
                1000IU three or four times daily. Also, Vitamin A 25 U (not beta carotene)
                and zinc 50mg are other natural therapies that are effective against viral
                illnesses. Beyond supplements, it is important to eat healthy with a diet
                free of refined sugar and flour as well as staying well hydrated.
              </p>

                Also, as proven by the overwhelming statistics from China, smoking and
                tobacco use of any amount carries a MUCH higher rate of illness and death
                from the virus. I am not an "expert" in complementary medicine but I know
                people who are. Please consider these simple and safe measures to protect
                yourself and your family.
